CDS develops thermal scene generation systems used to test and calibrate infrared detector arrays. For example, this diagram courtesy of the Air Force Research Laboratory, shows how the technology developed by Chip Design Systems will be used in a laboratory to evaluate how infrared guided missiles will perform during flight.

### IR Projectors

Major company focus is to develop integrated circuits, packaging solutions, hardware and software solutions used for thermal scene generation to test and calibrate infrared detector arrays.

The company is developing scene generation systems that display infrared images with cutting edge brightness, resolution, pixel size and speed.

CDS has licensed scene generation technology developed at University of Delaware for use in its products.

The company has several contracts with Department of Defense for the construction of prototype infrared scene generation systems and research into related technologies.
